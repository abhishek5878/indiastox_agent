# Progress

Backward-looking log. What happened, readable by a new session or a new engineer.

## 2026-05-16 — Phase 1: Scaffold the .claude/ directory and source-of-truth docs

### Actions taken
- Initialized git, made the "empty scaffold" first commit with SETUP.md, the IndiaStox brief, and a baseline `.gitignore`.
- Created `.claude/` skeleton per SETUP.md §3.
- Wrote the four `rules/` files (planning, git-practices, code-quality, session-persistence).
- Wrote the four `tasks/` working-memory files (todo, lessons, findings, progress).

### Files modified
- `.gitignore` — baseline ignore rules + carve-outs for `.claude/runs|logs|cache`.
- `.claude/rules/*.md` — four rule files, loaded on demand from CLAUDE.md.
- `.claude/tasks/*.md` — four working-memory files; only `todo.md` has live content so far.

### Issues encountered
- None this phase.

### Status
Phase 1 complete. Moving to Phase 2 (CLAUDE.md + starter skills).

## 2026-05-16 — Phase 2: Disciplines layer

### Actions taken
- Wrote `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (648 words, ~840 tokens, under the 1000-token hard rule).
- Wrote three starter skills: `plan`, `commit`, `verify`. Each has the §5.2 template structure with adversarial framing baked in.

### Files modified
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — IndiaStox-specific stack (TBD), code style, workflow, cross-model verification reminder, linked rules.
- `.claude/skills/{plan,commit,verify}/SKILL.md` — three starter skills.

### Status
Phase 2 complete.

## 2026-05-16 — Phase 3: Automation layer

### Actions taken
- Wrote six starter hook scripts (post-edit-format, post-edit-typecheck, pre-tool-use-plan, post-tool-use-progress, stop-verify, suggest-compact) as bash stubs. `chmod +x` applied.
- Wrote `.claude/settings.json` wiring hooks into PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop / UserPromptSubmit events with sensible matchers.
- Wrote two starter sub-agents: `planner` (Opus, planning-only) and `code-reviewer` (Opus, structured findings).

### Files modified
- `.claude/hooks/*.sh` — 6 hook scripts.
- `.claude/settings.json` — permissions + hooks block.
- `.claude/agents/{planner,code-reviewer}/*.md` — sub-agent definitions.

### Issues encountered
- Post-edit-format and post-edit-typecheck are no-op stubs because the stack is undecided. They emit a stderr note pointing at where to wire the real commands once the stack lands.

### Status
Phase 3 complete.

## 2026-05-16 — Phase 4: First plan + compounding-loop stubs

### Actions taken
- Wrote `.claude/tasks/task_plan.md` for the IndiaStox weekend prototype (per the brief §4): 7 phases covering stack pick, synthetic data, typed identity resolution, metric semantic layer, dashboard, position paper, closed-loop bonus event. Includes an adversarial-review section with three counterarguments.
- Wrote `.claude/rules/cross-model-verification.md` as a dedicated, discoverable home for the 15-exchange rule. CLAUDE.md also has the summary.
- Wrote `.claude/prompts/research-digest.md` + `.claude/research-digest.sh` for the research layer. Runner is a stub with TODOs pointing at the two cron-able invocation options.
- Wrote `.claude/hooks/log-events.sh` for the observation layer — appends every tool call and user prompt as one JSON line to `.claude/logs/events.jsonl` (gitignored).
- Wrote `.claude/prompts/self-edit-weekly.md` for the weekly ritual.
- Wrote `README.md` at repo root — points to SETUP.md as the operating manual, plus the agent-onboarding sequence.

### Files modified
- `.claude/tasks/task_plan.md` — first real feature plan.
- `.claude/rules/cross-model-verification.md` — discipline.
- `.claude/prompts/{research-digest,self-edit-weekly}.md` — prompts for the loop layers.
- `.claude/research-digest.sh` — daily runner stub.
- `.claude/hooks/log-events.sh` — observation hook (also wired in settings.json).
- `README.md` — repo entry point.

### Issues encountered
- None.

### Status
Phase 4 complete. All 13 SETUP.md §10 checklist items shipped.
